Data cleaning of Billy's booking data

# Problem statement

At my job I work with text files from 7 different sales channels that I clean manually in Excel for analysis. This is very time consuming and can take up to 30-40 minutes. In addition, some of the various sales channels add or remove collumns which mess up the pre-made formulas in my spredsheets when I import the data to Excel. 

# Description 

The application import all the columns into a pandas dataframe where blank rows are removed. The dataframe is then converted to an excel file ready for import into my spreadsheet. 

This specific application only sorts the booking data, where I've made 6 other similar applications to sort the other files. For further improving this application it could be  improved by making it differentiate between the different files so I don't need 7 different applications for each file. 

# Results 
 
 The application makes the 30-40 minutes task of data cleaning into a 5 minutes task where I just have to tell the application where the CSV file i wish filteret is located. In addition I don't have to worry if x channel adds or remove columns.
